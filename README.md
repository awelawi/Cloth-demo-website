# Cloth-demo-website
Random generation of clothes based on the weather!
This website was designed and implemented by Ella and Sicily for HackHolyoke 2021. Our idea is to develop an app that chooses the clothes a college student should wear based on the weather, their mood for today and color preference. Included in this file is a website demo of it as well as a mobile app design flow. We intend to complete this project.
Our weather implementation generates the weather for you based on your search preference. An interesting aspect is that it shows you landmarks or people from that location. Enjoy!
